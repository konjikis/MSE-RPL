Improving the RPL protocol in order to support mobility of all nodes and provide a seamless connection during the mobility. further, mobility of physical objects is supported which might cause a disconnection when an object acts as an obstacle between a pair of nodes. some other features are as follows: 1. implementing a dynamic trickle timer which breaks the trickle timer into a shorter time range to track the mobile node and turns to the default range when mobility had finished. 2. providing a very short hand-off delay 3. prevent losing data in case of a disconnection caused by a node's mobility or an obstacle entrance  -implemented by C in CONTIKI/Cooja Simulator -mobility plugin installation is needed
